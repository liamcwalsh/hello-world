	<h2 id="lambert"> Graph of the Lambert W Function </h2> 
	<p> This is a graph of the simple Lambert W function. Implicitly, it is defined as the inverse of</p>

	<span class="katex"> f(W)=We^W </span>

	<p> As far as the actual graph is concerned, it is a well behaved function for positive values. For x less than 0, the function becomes multivalued, up until x=(1/e). Then, the function branches off into the imaginary plane.</p>

	<p> There is an explicit equation which defines this function. It takes the form: </p>

	<span class="katex"> W(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {\frac{(-1)^{n-1} (n^{n-2})}{(n-1)!} x^n} </span>

	<a name="explambert"> <h2> Graph of W(e^x)</h2></a>

	<p> This graph shows the relationship between x and W(e^x). What is most interesting about this graph is the near-linearity it exhibits. There is a very good reason for this behavior. This near-linearity also makes for easy approximating. For a more formal discussion about this, I direct you to <a href="/opt_approx">this page </a> of my blog</p>

	<a name="powertower"> <h2> The Power Tower </h2></a>

	<p> This is the graph of what is called the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PowerTower.html"> Power Tower.</a> The Power Tower is a function of the form: </p>

	<span class="katex"> h(z)=z^{z^{z^{...}}} </span>

	<p> That is, this function is z to the power of z to the power of z on and on to infinity. This operation is known as tetration. Further, there is a simple mathematical symbol which describes tetration, called the Knuth Up Arrow:</p>

	<span class="katex"> z \uparrow \uparrow \infty = z^{z^{z^{...}}} </span> 

	<p> Here, z is the number to be tetrated, and infinity is the number of tetrations, that is, how many times you raise z to the z power. </p>

	<p> Interestingly enough, there is a simple equation that exists which can be used to calculate the value of the Power Tower for a given z. It involves the Lambert W function: </p>

	<span class="katex"> h(z) = -\frac{W(-ln(z))}{ln(z)}</span>

	<a name="opt-price"> <h2> Optimal Pricing Analysis </h2></a>

	<p> This graph shows a typical price vs. revenue graph. The W Function appears when trying to find the price which maximizes revenue. For a simple discrete choice model, the maximum price p&#42; takes the following form: </p>

	<span class="katex"> p^*=\frac{W(e^{\alpha -1}) +1}{\beta} </span>

	<p> A more formal discussion regarding pricing can be found at <a href="/discrete_choice"> this blog page </a> </p>

	<a name="zipfslaw"> <h2> Zipfs Law, Heaps' Law, and the W Function </h2> </a>

	<p> To discuss what this graph is, we must first discuss both Zipf's Law and Heaps' Law. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law"> Zipf's Law </a> is an empiraclly derived equation in linguistics, which states that the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its frequency ranking. More formally, </p>

	<span class="katex"> z(r)= \frac{z_{max}}{r^{\alpha}} </span>

	<p> Where z_max is the maximum frequency of a word occurence, and &alpha; is the Zipf's exponent, which is experimentally derived. </p>

	<p> Next, there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaps%27_law">Heaps' Law,</a> which is another empirical law that describes the number of distinct words in a document, depending on the document length. It is written as: </p>

	<span class="katex"> N(t)=t^{\lambda} </span>

	<p> Where t is the number of words, and &lambda; is another experimentally derived parameter. </p>

	<p> The Lambert W function appears when trying to relate Zipf's law and Heaps' law. In the special case when &alpha;, Zipf's Exponent, is equal to 1, Heaps' law can be rewritten as: </p>

	<span class="katex"> N(t)=\frac{t}{W(t)} </span>

	<p> This was result derived in <a href='http://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.3861v2.pdf'>this paper.</a></p>
